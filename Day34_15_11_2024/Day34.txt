Abstraction
process hiding the implementation details from the user and showing only the essential features of an object.

using interface
1. we can use only public static final variable and public and abstract methods
2. we cant use constructor SB & NSB
3. we can create ref var of interface but we cant create object of an interface
4. abstract method is always
	a. public
	b. non-static
	c. non-final
 along with abstract we cant use below keyword (Illegal combination)
	a. protected 
	b. private
	c. static
	d. final 
5. for abstract method overriding is mandatory

inheritance is interface

if both parent and child is interface we use extends keyword
if both parent and child is class we use extends keyword
if parent is interface and child is class we use implements keyword

Note: if parent is a class child can not be interface , child must be a class
