Data Type: Type of information stored

1 byte--> 8 bits

type casting 
converting from one data type to another data type is called as type casting

converting from smaller data type to bigger data type is called 'widening'
byte a=10;
short b=(short)a;

in the above code we are converting from byte to short --> widening

widening is automatic
short b=a;

converting from bigger data type to smaller data type is called 'narrowing'
narrowing is not automatic
short x=10;
byte y=(byte)x;

Boolean can not be converted to any other data type
any other DT can not be converted to Boolean type

Boolean can not be used in type casting

widening 				narrowing
smaller-> bigger			bigger--> smaller
automatic				explicit
no loss of data				there may be loss of data

byte a=10;				short a=10;
short b=a;				byte b=(byte)a;

operator
symbol which is used to perform some operation

operands
input required to perform the operation

example

System.out.println(a+b);

a and b are called as operands
+ is called as operator
the action 'addition'---> operation
