Inheritance is the process by which objects of one class acquire the properties of objects of another class

using the key extends /implements 

parent class super class base class
child class  sub class 	derived class


this--> keyword to store address of current class object
this.i--> accessing i variable present in current class object
this()--> statement to call once constructor from another constructor same class

super-->keyword to store address of parent class object
super.i--> accessing i variable present in parent class object
super()-->statement to call parent class constructor from child class constructor 

when we must have UDC in child class?
when we cant have default constructor in child class?


if parent class does not contain 'no arg constructor' then in child class we cant have default constructor

when it is mandatory to write super statement?
if parent class has only parameterized constructor 


in java w.r.t class it supports only
single inheritance
multi level inheritance
Hierarchical inheritance

it does not support
multiple inheritance
hybrid inheritance
recursive inheritance

what is inherited to child class from parent class?
1. variables *    
2. methods *

*---> if it is private , it is not inherited
----> if it is package private and child is in diff package then also it is not inherited

what is not inherited to child class from parent class?
1. constructor 
2. SIB
3. IIB


if any class is present in current package or in java.lang we need not import it
ex: String  System

we can access the class present in diff package using its FQCN (without import)

if 2 class having same name present in diff package, how do u access it?
we can import only one class
for other class we should use FQCN
