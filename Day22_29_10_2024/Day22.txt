class
Blue print or template

object
instance/copy of the class 

how to create a class?
use class keyword then class name and then { }

How to create object of the class?
ClassName var=new ClassName();

members--> anything present inside the class such as
1. variable
2. methods
3. constructor
4. blocks
5. inner class
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. we compile --> javac Demo2.java--> we get Demo2.class
2. we execute--> java Demo2
3. it will start JVM
4. it will call class loader
5. class loader will load byte code of Demo2 into class area
6. it will also load static member (main method) into static pool
7. static pool name will be same as class name (Demo2)
8. loads main method into stack and starts the execution of main method

any variable declared inside the class--> global variable 
any variable declared inside any block such as method...--> local variable

global variable will have default value* based on its data type---->
primitive --> 
byte short int long--> 0 as default value
float double--> 0.0
boolean--> false
char--> ' '

non-primitive
array class interface Enum--> null

address of the object is also called as reference 
reference variable--> non-primitive var

dot .---> access operator , used to access the member of the class/object
.---> go to that address


in java class is a data type
1. built in class-->String
2. user defined class--> Emp

constructor
1. special method --> name is same as class name
2. no return type (not even void)
