containsKey
containsValue
keyset
size
remove(key)
clear()
isEmpty()

Note: key cant be duplicate


HashTable
1. key cant be null
2. value cant be null
3. it will not preserve insertion order
4. present from JDK 1.0
5. legacy class
6. parent: Map
7. Thread-safe
8. slow
9. underlying data structure is buckets

HashMap

8. fast
9. underlying data structure is balanced tree


LinkedHashMap

9. underlying data structure is hashtable+ double linked list

TreeMap
1. key CANT be null
2. value can be null
3. it will sorting insertion order of the key
