constructor overloading--> having multiple constructors with diff signature
constructor chaining--> calling one constructor from another using this()

static and non-static variables

static variables				non-static variables
variable is declared using static keyword	variable is declared without using static keyword	
stored in static pool				stored in object (heap)
always single copy				multiple copy (depends on number of objects)
accessed using class name			accessed using ref var or using 'this.'
public/common/shared information		private/individual information
ex: Bank Name, IFSC Branch			Account No. Name Account Balance PAN

Note: 
Static & Non-Static concept is applicable only for global variable
for local variables there is no concept of Static & Non-Static variable

types of variable
1. scope: global and local
2. data type: primitive & non-primitive
3. change of value: final or non-final variable
4. copy: static or non-static 


when the variable gets default value?
if the variable is global and non-final then it gets default value

Note:
if the variable is final --> no default value
if the variable is local--> no default value

class loading
1. load the byte code of the class into class area
2. create memo in static pool
3. load static variable and methods into SP
4. execute static block 

when the static block gets executed?
at the time of class loading

Note:
we cant execute static block explicitly or multiple times
(we cant call static block)

we can have multiple static blocks  and they will always executes from top to bottom


when the non-static block gets executed?
before the execution of the constructor


if both static block and main method present in same class then when execute the code ,
static block gets executed 1st and then the main method


if both static block and main method present in diff class then when execute the code ,
main method gets executed 1st and then the static block
