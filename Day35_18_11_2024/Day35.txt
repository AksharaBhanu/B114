interface
1. variables--> only public static final
2. methods-> only public and abstract
3. constructor->no
4. SB->no
5. NSB-->No
6. ref variable-> yes
7. object->no
8. abstract method makes overriding mandatory
	
illegal combination
1. abstract private
2. abstract final
3. abstract static 


abstract class
a class which contains at least one abstract method
1. abstract method may be inherited from parent interface
2. abstract method may be declared inside the class


if the class is declared as abstract we cant create its object
inside abstract class
1. all the methods can be abstract
2. all the methods can be concrete
3. some of the methods can be abstract and some of them can be concrete

can we have concrete method in interface?
yes from JDK 1.8 
concrete method
1. static public /private
2. non-static  public /private

Note: method cant be protected of package private, it can only be either public or private
