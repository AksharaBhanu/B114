Types of interface
1. marker interface/Tagging Interface---> Serializable
2. functional interface/ Single Abstract Method (SAM) interface-->Comparable Constable
3. normal interface--> contains multiple abstract methods
4. default interface--> interface which contains only default methods ( non-static concrete methods)
5. static interface--> interface which contains only static methods
6. hybrid interface--> contains both abstract and concrete methods


to store primitive data type as object we have set of classes which are called
as wrapper classes
byte-->Byte
short--> Short
int--> Integer
long-->Long
float-->Float
double-->Double
char--> Character
boolean--> Boolean

all wrapper classes are present in java.lang package (no need to import)
in all wrapper classes toString method is overridden
all wrapper classes are final
all wrapper classes implements Comparable interface
We can create object of Wrapper class without using new keyword

boxing-->converting from primitive to non-primitive
unboxing-->converting from non-primitive to primitive

both boxing & unboxing are automatic
