static block
  we create SB using static keyword followed by {}
  static blocks are executed at the time of class loading
  it is executed only once
  other name: SIB
  we can access only static variable inside SIB but we cant access non-static variable inside SIB
  we cant use  this keyword inside SIB

non-static block
  we create NSB without using static keyword just {}
  non-static blocks are executed before the constructor
  it is executed each time when we call constructor/create object
  other name: IIB
  we can access both static & non-static variable inside IIB
  We can use this keyword inside IIB


default value for variable is assigned only if it is global and non-final
default value  not applicable for all the local variable and for global final var

inside the class we can only
1. declare variables
2. create blocks (SB NSB constructor method)
inside the class we are not allowed write any other java code 

if the variable is final then it is mandatory to explicitly initialize it (default value  not applicable)
for global static final variable , we can initialize it in 2 ways
1. at the time of declaration
2. inside the static block

static block are majorly used for initializing static final variables hence it is also called as
Static Initialization Block (SIB)

for global non-static final variable , we can initialize it in 3 ways
1. at the time of declaration
2. inside the non-static block
3. inside the constructor

non-static block are majorly used for initializing non-static final variables hence it is also called as
Instance Initialization Block (IIB)

class
--> variable
--> constructor
--> SB-->SIB
--> NSB--> IIB
--> methods
	2 types
	static method
	non-static method

we call static method using class name
we call non-static method using ref var (object)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
when do we declare a variable as non-static?
if the variable is used to store private/individual information

when do we declare a variable as static?
if the variable is used to store common/public/shared information

when do we declare a method as non-static?
if method is accessing at least one non-static variable of the class

when do we declare a method as static?
if method is not accessing any non-static variable of the class

summarize it
by default we should create static method, if we need to access any non-static variable inside the method
then only declare the method as non-static
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in which are the places we can use this keyword?
inside
1. IIB
2. constructor
3. non-static method

we cant use 'this' inside IIB & static method 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inside a class can we declare and initialize non-primitive variable?
yes 

inside a class can we create object of other class?
yes
