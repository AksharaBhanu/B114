Exception:
Unexpected event is called as exception

When exception occurs , JVM will throw error msg and stops the execution

To continue the execution we must handle the exception

exception propagation--> when exception is generated and not handled , control will be transferred back to the caller along with error  


stack trace--> printing details of exception propagation is called as stack trace

Normal termination--> if the java code gets executed till the end of main method without any exception then it is called as Normal termination

Abnormal termination--> if there is any exception and it is not handled then JVM will call Default Exception Handler - this DEH will print stack trace and terminate the JVM -this is called as Abnormal termination

exception generated but not handled anywhere (not even in main method)

Graceful termination-->  if there is any exception and it is handled

Exception Types
1.Checked Exception--> InterruptedException
2.Unchecked Exception--> ArithmeticException
