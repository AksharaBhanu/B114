in  a class can we create multiple constructor?
yes, but signature should be diff

signature means--> number of arg , or data type or order

if we create ,multiple constructor with diff signature--> constructor overloading


can we call a constructor from another constructor?
yes using this of --> this();

but
1. this() must be the 1st statement
2. recursive constructor calling is not allowed 


Note: calling a constructor from another constructor is also called as constructor chaining


what is the diff b/w this. and this()
this. -->access global variable when the local variable name is same  
this()--> call constructor from another constructor 		


by default all variables declared inside class (but outside of any block) 
1. are called instance variable	or object variable
2. each object will have their own copy of these instance variable
3. we can access these instance variable using ref variable or this.
4. scope of these variable is global (anywhere within the class)


if we add the keyword 'static'
1. are called static variable	or class variable
2. they are stored inside static pool of the respective class
3. static var is always a single copy stored inside static pool
4. every object by default will have access to respective class's static pool
5. we can access class variable using class name 


Note: using object/ref variable we can access both static and non-static variable
but using class name we can access only static variable

whether variable should be static or non-static
if we are storing individual or private information use non-static variable--diff copy for each object
if we are storing public or common information use static variable--> single copy for all the object
