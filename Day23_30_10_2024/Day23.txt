Constructor
1. is a special method available in class
2. name of the Constructor must be same as class name
3. Constructor will not have any return type (not even void)
4. when we create a class without constructor then compiler adds 'default constructor'
5. default constructor is always no arg Constructor 
6. constructor created by us is called as User Defined constructor
7. User Defined constructor can be no arg Constructor OR parameterized constructor

if name of global variable and local variable is same then it always refers to local variable

if name of global variable and local variable is same then using this keyword is mandatory to access global variable
if name of global variable and local variable is diff then we can access global variable using this keyword and also access it directly


this
1. it is a keyword
2. it represents current object (stores address of current object)  'this means current object'
3. used to access global variable when local variable name is also same
